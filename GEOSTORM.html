<h1 style="background-color: Cyan;"><u>Review</u></h1>
<article class="browser">
<h2 style="background-color: LightGreen;"></h2>
<p style="text-indent: 65px;">Geostorm excels in depicting of large-scale destruction, offering stunning visuals of tidal waves, and etc. These are undeniably its strongest aspect.
However, the film struggles with its storytelling, and characters. The plot, while interesting in concept, feels rushed and predictable, relying on clichés. The characters, especially Jake and Max, lack depth, and their sibling rivalry is not compelling enough to carry the emotional weight of the story. The dialogue often leans into melodrama, detracting from the film’s intensity. It does attempt to explore relevant themes albeit poorly, such as climate change and international cooperation. As they are ultimately surface level and remain superficial with the movie choosing to focus on its spectacle over making anything of substance.</p>

<article class="browser">
<h2 style="background-color: LightGreen;"></h2>
<p style="text-indent: 65px;">Geostorm while visually spectacular is narratively flawed. While it won’t join the ranks of genre-defining classics, it does provide plenty of exciting action for those willing to overlook its flaws. If you’re in the mood for a cinematic thrill ride through climate chaos and don’t care much about quality then Geostorm is worth a watch for you.</p>
